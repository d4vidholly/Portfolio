    <h2>Peppermint OT</h2>
    <p><b>Brief:</b> "I need an easy to use, responsive webpage for my Occupational Therapy business. Support Coordinators will use it to review my skillset and contact me for appointments."</p>
</div>
<p><b>Roles:</b> UX Researcher, Graphic / UI / UX Designer, Web Developer</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Research: </b>Users want a clear, easy to use webpage outlining contact info, location and services. They are frustrated by other sites where this isn’t obvious. Users value building a relationship with the OT to understand their values and how they work.</li>
      <li><b>Design: </b>Prototyping reduced 50% of the initial content to create a clearer message. Testing showed a sticky CTA performed better than a nav bar link. Users described the tone of the page as 'friendly' and 'fresh'.</li>
      <li><b>Outcomes: </b>Positive user feedback, no reported issues of not finding information. Users felt they could trust the client to deliver and were encouraged to connect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>"David undertook valuable design research to understand Support Coordinators and their goals. This shows as I've had really positive feedback about my brand and it has already helped me build professional connections." - Becky, Owner</i></p>

        <p><b>Key Design Features: </b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Research: </b>Users thought landing page navigation was unclear and wanted obvious ways to get involved. Secondary research showed branded donation pages can raise 6x more. </li>
          <li><b>Design:</b> Conducted Information Architecture audit to reduce nav bar icons and include a Shop section on page. Used imagery and color to improve navigation on the page, strengthen brand identity and create a clearer donation message.</b></li>
          <li><b>Outcomes:</b> Testing revealed users enjoyed the 'clean', responsive update. A clearer understanding of the mission and the concept of a donation goal connected users to get involved.</li>
