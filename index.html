    <h2>Peppermint OT</h2>
    <p><b>Brief:</b> "I need an easy to use, responsive webpage for my Occupational Therapy business. Support Coordinators will use it to review my skillset and contact me for appointments."</p>
</div>
<p><b>Roles:</b> UX Researcher, Graphic / UI / UX Designer, Web Developer</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Research: </b>Users want a clear, easy to use webpage outlining contact info, location and services. They are frustrated by other sites where this isn’t obvious. Users value building a relationship with the OT to understand their values and how they work.</li>
      <li><b>Design: </b>Prototyping reduced 50% of the initial content to create a clearer message. Testing showed a sticky CTA performed better than a nav bar link. Users described the tone of the page as 'friendly' and 'fresh'.</li>
      <li><b>Outcomes: </b>Positive user feedback, no reported issues of not finding information. Users felt they could trust the client to deliver and were encouraged to connect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><i>"David undertook valuable design research to understand Support Coordinators and understand their needs. I've had really positive feedback about my brand and it has already helped me build professional connections." - Becky, Owner</i></p>
